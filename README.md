This script automates the process of downloading the Capsicum annuum genome, decompressing, indexing it, and extracting context sequences around specified SNP coordinates. It first downloads the genome file from the Ensembl FTP server, decompresses it, and indexes it using samtools. Then, it converts an input CSV file containing SNP coordinates into a BED file, extracting 20 bp upstream and downstream of each SNP (customizable based on research needs). Finally, it uses bedtools to extract the corresponding sequences from the indexed genome and saves them in a FASTA format file. The script provides a straightforward workflow for sequence extraction based on SNP coordinates, suitable for genomic analysis.
