# Script to download a Capsicum annuum genome, decompress it, index it, and extract context sequences based on given coordinates from a CSV file.
# This script is intended to be used in a Linux environment.

# Step 1: Download the Capsicum annuum genome in FASTA format from Ensembl FTP server
# The file will be downloaded as a compressed `.gz` file.
echo "Downloading the Capsicum annuum genome..."
wget https://ftp.ensemblgenomes.ebi.ac.uk/pub/plants/release-60/fasta/capsicum_annuum/dna/Capsicum_annuum.ASM51225v2.dna.toplevel.fa.gz

# Step 2: Decompress the downloaded genome file
# After downloading, decompress the file using gzip.
echo "Decompressing the genome file..."
gzip -d Capsicum_annuum.ASM51225v2.dna.toplevel.fa.gz

# Step 3: Index the reference genome using samtools
# The genome must be indexed to allow fast sequence retrieval.
echo "Indexing the genome..."
samtools faidx Capsicum_annuum.ASM51225v2.dna.toplevel.fa

# Step 4: Prepare the input CSV file for sequence extraction
# Assume the CSV file contains the following columns: SNP, Chr, position, upstream, downstream.
# Convert the CSV file into a BED file containing chromosome, start position, and end position.
# The upstream and downstream columns define the flanking regions.
# The length of the flanking sequences depends on your research objective.
# For this study, it was 20 bp upstream and downstream of the SNP coordinates.
# Make sure that the start position is smaller than the end position to avoid errors in the extraction process.
# You can transfer the SNP coordinates file (fs.csv) from your local machine to the server using FileZilla.
echo "Converting the CSV file into a BED file..."
awk -F, 'NR>1 {print $2 "\t" $4 "\t" $5}' fs.csv > flanking_region.bed

# Step 5: Extract the context sequences using bedtools getfasta
# Using the indexed genome and the BED file, extract sequences from the specified regions.
# The output will be saved as fs.fa in FASTA format.
echo "Extracting context sequences..."
bedtools getfasta -fi Capsicum_annuum.ASM51225v2.dna.toplevel.fa -bed flanking_region.bed -fo fs.fa

# Step 6: Output completion message
# The extracted sequences are saved in the fs.fa file, which contains the context sequences.
echo "Context sequences have been successfully extracted and saved in fs.fa."
